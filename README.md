This is a small library that allows you to control the Syma S107 IR helicopter with any IR blaster enabled android device.

## How to use:

Add the following line to your AndroidManifest

```XML
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.TRANSMIT_IR" />
```

Then import the Transmitter.java file to the file calling it.
